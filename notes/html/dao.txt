A Dao of Web Design, John Allsopp

Adaptability is accessibility
The best of man is like water,
Which benefits all things, and does not contend with them,
Which flows in places that others disdain,
Where it is in harmony with the Way.
Tao Te Ching; 8 Water

        "one should wander, without plan, 
        allowing for things to happen and to respond to them. 
        I think of it as saying we should not be fixed in our outlook, 
        with goals far ahead, 
        rather we should be adaptable, not fixed in our views or direction."

Adaptability is accessibility
The best of man is like water,
Which benefits all things, and does not contend with them,
Which flows in places that others disdain,
Where it is in harmony with the Way.

        make pages which are adaptable. 
        Make pages which are accessible, 
        regardless of the browser, 
        platform or screen that your reader chooses 
        or must use to access your pages. 

        pages which are legible regardless 
        of screen resolution or size, 
        or number of colors 
        (and remember too that pages may be printed, 
        or read aloud by reading software, 
        or read using braille browsers). 

        pages which adapt to the needs of a reader, 
        whose eyesight is less than perfect, 
        and who wishes to read pages with a very large font size.

        Designing adaptable pages is designing accessible pages. 
        And perhaps the great promise of the web, 
        far from fulfilled as yet, is accessibility, 
        regardless of difficulties, to information.


The Way
The Way is shaped by use,
But then the shape is lost.
Do not hold fast to shapes
But let sensation flow into the world
As a river courses down to the sea.



The Journey
Yet a tree broader than a man can embrace is born of a tiny shoot;
A dam greater than a river can overflow starts with a clod of earth;
A journey of a thousand miles begins at the spot under one’s feet.

“Closely held beliefs are not easily released.”
The journey begins by letting go of control, and becoming flexible.

I often find myself using programming as a metaphor to many things in life. 
After reading 'A Dao of Web Design', I quickly semented that the idea that, yes, 
I am not crazy. Programming ideas could be used as metaphors to life. 
"The journey begins by letting go of control, and becoming flexible."
I recently had a convseration with Ben about my goal and how I go through 
life without one fixed goal. I allow myself to adapt to life and wander, 
without a plan. After putting this idea into words and saying it outloud,
I quickly became embarrased, 'How could i just wander through life 
without a plan?'.

If find that this approach allows opportunity to become accessible.
If I move through life with one absolute goal, I may not be as flexible, 
rather static and fixed in my outlook.
