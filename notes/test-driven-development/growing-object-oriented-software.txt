verification vs design

The Bigger Picture
    When implemmenting a feature we want to write an acceptance test 
        that exercises the functionality we want to build
        an acceptance test demonstrates that te system does not implemet 
            that feature
        We use acceptance test to write code thats direct;y relevant 
    
    Under apprectance test, we follow the unit level test/implement/refactor 
    cycle to develop the feature

                                    --------->
                                    |
    Write a failing -----------> Write a  
    acceptance test             unit test
