<!-- Rebase -->
$git pull --rebase while in master
        -   To get square and assure that any commits 
            I alone have are reapplied atop those 
            coming from origin

$git rebase master
        -   rebase our PR branch the same reason we used --rebase: 
            we want to ensure that our changes are reapplied on 
            top of any changes already integrated into origin/master 
            (the Hub of our collaboration)


<!-- Merge -->
we likely want master to look like the branch underlying this pull request

$git merge --ff-only <branch-name>
        -   merged in the pull request locally

--ff-only :
        -   Refuse to merge and exit with a non-zero status 
            unless the current HEAD is already up to date or 
            the merge can be resolved as a fast-forward
        -   By including this flag, though, we’re telling 
            git we want this to fail if it’s not a fast forward

<!-- Push -->
$ git push && git push origin :<branch-name> && git branch -d <branch-name>
                |
                git push origin :<branch-name>, will delete a remote branch

<!-- git poosh plugin (oh-my-zsh) -->
$ gpp <branch-name>
        -   will push the current branch and delete the remote and 
            local feature branches, with branch autocomplete
