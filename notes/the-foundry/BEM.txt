 BEM -- BLock Element Modifier 

Block: The outermost parent element of the component is defined as the block.
Element: Inside of the component may be one or more children called elements.
Modifier: Either a block or element may have a variation signified by a modifier.

If all three are used in a name it would look something like this:

[block]__[element]--[modifier]
