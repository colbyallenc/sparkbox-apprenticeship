If your code reviewer ain't happy, ain't nobody happy!!!!!!!!

Why PR?:
    Having good commit messages will aid in the reviewer 
    seeing what is trying to be accomplished.

Seperate your PR to be clear:
    If the PR is doing too much, maybe it should be 
    separated into multiple requests.

    the word and generally means that this commit/pull request is doing too much

Rebase: 
    If you're not the only developer on the project, 
    there's a good chance that other changes have been 
    merged into master while you've been working

    rebase your code to make sure that what you are 
    submitting includes the most recent changes

    it may be better to have one commit in the history, 
    like "feat: Adds homepage slider."                          
                                                                    |
    before I submit the PR, do a "git rebase -i master" (interactive rebase) 
                                             |
                            This allows me to combine my commit messages for this 
                            feature into one final message.
