Gonna start a journal in this sb repo as i code.. to realllly keep up

There a lot that i must keep in mind while coding... stay mindful.
for yourself and for others... coming back and being able to read and undertsnad oyur own code is a blessing. 
the ability to do that with others' code is even better. 

theres a lott that you have to keep in mind WHILE you code... to make your life a lot easier in the long run.
a few extra seconds never killed anyone.... or did it?!? ;D

having trouble trying to figure out why my github is showing commit by 2 users..

Gem City JS in t minus 34 min.... more to come. 
...
biggest takeaway: lets bring back data visualization.. im into that. 
                there are lots of tools to do data visualization. front-end
                frameworks accept this. keys: workflow & documentation. 
                *refer to data-visualization in notes

Lately I've been working with iterating over matrices. Theres been so much to 
discover here for example. How will you choose to iterate over this array of 
arrays? You have so many methods including older more prestegious es5 methods, 
or our very convenient es6 methods.

03.04.19
We are coming to our final few weeks of the first stage. I get really excited to 
want to create some large scaled project but i have to keep remembering to focus 
myself in diving deep into the front end.

Two interesting convos i had today:
        Ryan on CircleCi, Linting, and CodeClimate
        Gary on the two ways i will work work testing (i love testing btw - new found love)
            I will work on driving my development with test, and on the other hand,
            I will work on going back and building test around past work
            Gary stresses that both are important in their own unique way.
