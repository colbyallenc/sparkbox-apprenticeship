There a lot that i must keep in mind while coding... stay mindful.
for yourself and for others... coming back and being able to read and undertsnad oyur own code is a blessing. 
the ability to do that with others' code is even better. 

theres a lott that you have to keep in mind WHILE you code... to make your life a lot easier in the long run.
a few extra seconds never killed anyone.... or did it?!? ;D

Lately I've been working with iterating over matrices. Theres been so much to 
discover here for example. How will you choose to iterate over this array of 
arrays? You have so many methods including older more prestegious es5 methods, 
or our very convenient es6 methods.
